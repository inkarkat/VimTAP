The Test Anything Protocol makes testing with different languages in the same project
easy. It decouples the tests generating results from the harness interpreting the results.
With VimTAP we now have TAP for vim.

For now the following is implemented:
 - Plan
 - Ok
 - Is & Isnt
 - Like & Unlike
 - Diag

Diag is probably not completely functional, yet. \n, \r and \r\n are all considered to
delimit lines.

Also a driver for running the tests from outside vim is provided. It can be used with
Perl's TAP::Parser runtests utility.

This package is still work in progress!
